    \noindent On the fourth occasion of the \emph{Applied Physics Laboratory} we've learned the basic of the usage of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The nature of this lecture was purely informative, where we didn't have any complex calculation or measurement task, besides a very short one. Our objective was to learn, how to set up the SEM, to take somewhat higher-quality pictures, which could be further analysed if needed.
